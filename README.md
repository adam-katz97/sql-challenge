# sql-challenge
This assignment had me create multiple data tables and make a schema that connected them all through the use of primary keys 
and foreign keys. At first I had trouble importing data from the csv files but that was due to me making an incorrect assumption of what data
was best suited to be used as primary keys as well as me having the coloumns out of order. Once I had solved that the rest was easy.
I had a bit of difficulty with the select/join coding but once i realized that i do not need to select what i am joining on in my actual data 
table it became much easier to format everything the way I wanted it to be.
